# Userscrips galore! 

mainly keeping stamp helper up to date lmfao, hope to make some other useful scripts

### Stamp album helper:

Shows not owned stamps in their respective places even if they're not in your collection, great work by Eat Wooloos As Mutton.

### Ye Olde Vortex quick change:

Shows links to change active pet in the "Reel In Your Line" screen, clicking the pet changes your active.

### Ye Olde Vortex quick change Legacy Version:

Shows links to change active pet in the "Cast your line again?" screen, clicking the pet fishes for you with the selected pet, deemed too automatic by mods, don't DL unless you're smelly.

### Turmy pet change

Pretty much the same idea behind the vortex scripts but it shows petpets in the turmac screen, future improvements would be showing the petpet's names ala grave danger.
